This repository contains the codes to implement cubical persistence algorithm in TDA to extract topological features from chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia. 

Dataset resource: PneumoniaMNIST from MedMNIST 

In the following files, there are codes for pipeline visualization for a sample image data, codes for constructing/generating cubical complexes from a sample image, codes for computation of cubical persistence/Persistence Diagrams and codes for some exploration on vectorization tools (computing Betti functions, persistence images and extracting meaningful feature vectors) We used Randon Forest and Logistic Regression models to train the machine with these features to predict the diagnosis.
